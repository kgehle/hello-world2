# hello-world2
This is the second attempt, but this time with a description.
I am an old fart who is learning programming after 37 years away.  Back then, it was Fortran, Basic, and later some Cobol. I took an online class for C++ but didn't complete it because I apparently wasn't into the completion thing back then. : )
